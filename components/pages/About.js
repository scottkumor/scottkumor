            I'm a Web Developer based in the Greater Chicago area. Currently I am
            looking for positions working on the front end - HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
            and React are the tools I'm most comfortable working with.

            I hold a Bachelors of Administration in Information Systems from the
            University of Cincinnati Lindner College of Business and I recently earned a
            certificate from Northwestern University's Trilogy Full Stack Web
            Development Boot Camp program, focusing on the MERN Stack.

            In my free-time I enjoy playing music on my various instruments
            including my guitars, drum kit, and other small instruments.
            I am also a skiier, snowboarder, and skateboarder, and like to play golf and tennis.
