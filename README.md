# Scott Kumor - Portfolio Website
This is the repo for my personal website, a portfolio showcasing my design skills and past projects.

This website runs on React.js, styled with (almost) pure CSS and HTML in JSX files.
I've utilized code from these frameworks:
  - create-react-app
  - react-router-dom
  - react-animate-on-scroll by dbramwell (and by extension Animate.css by Daniel Eden et al) 
  - react-fade-in by gkaemmer
  - react-responsive-carousel by leandrowd
  - simple-react-modal by dphaener and zackify
  - "CSS Only Random Text Transform (Animated)" by lefoy on codepen
