                    I'm a Web Developer based in the Greater Chicago area. Currently I am
                    looking for positions working on the front end - HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
                    and React are the tools I'm most comfortable working with.

                    certificate from Northwestern University's Trilogy Full Stack Web

                    In my free-time I enjoy playing music on my various instruments
                    including my guitars, drum kit, and other small instruments.
                    I am also a skiier, snowboarder, and skateboarder, and enjoy playing golf and tennis.
