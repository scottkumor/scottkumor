                    I'm a Web Developer based in the Greater Chicago area. Currently I am
                    looking for positions working on the front end - HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
                    and React are the tools I'm most comfortable working with.

                    I hold a Bachelors of Business Administration in Information Systems from the
                    University of Cincinnati Lindner College of Business and I recently earned a
                    certificate from Northwestern University's Trilogy Full Stack Web
                    Development Boot Camp program, focusing on the MERN Stack.

                    In my free-time I enjoy playing music on my various instruments
                    including my guitars, drum kit, and other small instruments.
                    I am also a skiier, snowboarder, and skateboarder, and enjoy playing golf and tennis.
